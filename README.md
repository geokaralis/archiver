# Archiver ðŸ—„

Archiver was meant to be a project about compressing and decompressing files using the underline 7zip technologies. The idea was a dead simple app for Windows with no UI! That would be possible with some advanced techniques used in the Windows file explorer. Thought the idea remained, well an idea, it's possible that someday it will see the light of day, and a dead simple Windows app will be used for archiving and unarchiving nearly every format.

If that idea sounds good to you give me a heads up and we can start developing a free, as in beer, archiver
